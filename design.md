### Two Concepts in naming things
1. taxonomy: component's name, category, variation, example
2. codes

### New System Categories
- [visual style](/concepts/style/) (visual language or design language): color palette, typography, icons, white space, photography, properties of things.
- [components](/concepts/components/) (elements, reusable parts): button, form, list, grid, layout. A component can contain a component.
- [patterns](/concepts/patterns/) (principled guidance to interpret): set of guidelines or principles that help designers interpret user needs, design goals, and technical constraints to create effective and user-friendly websites. These principles often draw on cognitive psychology, usability testing, and design theory.
